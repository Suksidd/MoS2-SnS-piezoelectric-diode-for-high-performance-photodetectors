In this paper, a flexible piezoelectric photodiode was fabricated using SnS and MoS2, and its parameters were calculated.

A single monolayer flake strained by 0.53% generates a peak output of 25 mV and 50 pA, corresponding to a power density of 20 mW mâˆ’2 and a 15.08% mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency.
